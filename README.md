# SchoolDB 
<h2> School database system </h2>
<p>  The main point of this assigment is to learn how use Entityt Framework. Implementing these varius functions: </p>

<br>
<p> C
Create simple navigation in the program allowing the user to choose between the following functions:

Fetch personnel (can be done using ADO.NET and SQL, or Entity Framework)

The user can choose to see all employees or filter by categories such as teachers.

Fetch all students (should be done using Entity Framework)

The user can choose to sort students by first or last name, in ascending or descending order.

Fetch all students in a specific class (should be done using Entity Framework)

The user first sees a list of all classes, then chooses a class to display all students in that class.

Extra Challenge: Allow the user to also choose the sorting of students as in the previous point.

Fetch all grades set in the last month (can be done using ADO.NET and SQL, or Entity Framework)

The user directly sees a list of all grades set in the last month, showing the student's name, course name, and the grade.

Fetch a list of all courses and the average grade, highest grade, and lowest grade that any student has received in the course (can be done using ADO.NET and SQL, or Entity Framework)

The user directly sees a list of all courses in the database, the average grade, and the highest and lowest grades for each course.

Tip: It might be challenging to do this with letter grades, so you can choose to store grades as numbers instead.

Add new students (can be done using ADO.NET and SQL, or Entity Framework)

The user can input details for a new student, and the data is then saved to the database.

Add new personnel (should be done using Entity Framework)

The user can input details for a new employee, and the data is then saved to the database.</p>

<h2>Room for improvments</h2>
<p>Allthough this program meet the requirements i aim to improve som of the parts, like error handling. Better UI and overall better performance for more optimize program. </p>
